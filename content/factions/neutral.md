Some people managed to buy or cheat their way into the NETSEC crew for their own personal gain.
They have their own agenda that can be met regardless of who – in the end – wins.
Some of these people may lean more towards a faction than the other,
but will win the game only if their own conditions have been met,
regardless of the outcome of the game
(neutrals wins/loss are calculated independently from the NETSEC/AGENT wins/loss system).
