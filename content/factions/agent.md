The **AGENT** faction is tasked in bringing the NETSEC crew to justice.
This group is heavily underfunded and cannot run a massive operation by force and has to rely on their undercover operation.
They are often criticized for their unorthodox methods and nobody cares as long as they get their job done.

**WINNING CONDITION**:
the game ends when the AGENT faction has gained root access of the NETSEC LEADER computer (by making him/her trusting them)
or when all NETSEC members have been are removed from play.
