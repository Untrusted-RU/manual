The **NETSEC** faction is a hacking crew that has been assembled by an unknown mastermind.
Their goal is to gain control (root access) of a specific server of a target network.
Nobody really knows their previous exploits and if they are just criminals or if they are working towards a more noble goal.
Truth is, their methods are often very illegal, if not entirely evil.

**WINNING CONDITION**:
the game ends when the NETSEC group has gained root access of the target node or when all AGENTs have been removed from play.
